# git_bash_here.bat
*Incredibly* simple Windows batch file to open Git Bash in the directory where the file is placed.

It is just one line long, but it will open Git Bash with the root already set. It'll use the (in my opinion) best version of the shell, coloured Git Bash in the command prompt.

Since the release of Windows 11, I've used this file with all my Git Repos, since the right click menu option is so buried now.
